    This scale is based on an aggregate of the World Health Organization
    [global air quality guidelines](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228) 
    and [Personal interventions and risk communication on Air Pollution](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240000278)
    reports.

    The lowest part of the range map to the AQG (Air Quality Goal)
    target, a PM<sub>2.5</sub> level of <5 μg/m<sup>3</sup> which is considered relatively safe.
    The upper part, >100 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, is considered the level where the 
    health benefits of regular physical activity is greatly offset by the
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure.

    Note that the level of <5 μg/m<sup>3</sup> is the AQG exposure
    level on an annaul basis. The WHO also has a 24-hour AQG level of
    <15 μg/m<sup>3</sup> which is not included in this scale. As we're
    trending patterns over time, the annual target made more sense for
    the heatmap.
