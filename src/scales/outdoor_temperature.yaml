    Outdoor temperatures related to human comfort and risk levels.
    
    Note that this works best when using apparent (or [wet bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature))
    temperature and taking wind chill into account, not just [dry bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-bulb_temperature)
    temperature, such as a like a thermometer reading.

    Individual factors such as clothing, activity level, wind speed and
    exposure to sun all play a part in how we perceive temperature.
    See this is a rough guideline.
