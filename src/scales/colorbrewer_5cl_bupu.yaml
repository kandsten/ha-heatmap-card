    Colors by Cynthia Brewer, [colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org).

    ColorBrewer provides guidance when selecting colors for map visualisations,
    making them distinct. While it's not a _perfect_ fit for a gradient scale,
    such as this one, the colors are picked out to be safe for color blindness
    and offer improved distinction between the various parts of the band.
